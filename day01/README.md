##  1. Different Types of Cyber-Profeesionals:

Cybersecurity professionals typically work in one of three core teams:

###  Red Team â€“ The Offensive Experts
- Focuses on simulating real cyberattacks to identify weaknesses  
- Mimics the behavior of malicious hackers  
- Helps organizations find and fix security gaps before real attackers do

###  Blue Team â€“ The Defenders
- Responsible for defending networks and systems from threats  
- Detects, responds to, and prevents attacks in real time  
- Uses tools such as antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, and firewalls

###  Purple Team â€“ The Bridge Between Red and Blue
- Coordinates efforts between Red and Blue teams  
- Encourages collaboration to improve both attack simulation and defense tactics  
- Ensures continuous improvement in an organizationâ€™s security posture

##  2. Common Types of Cyber Threats

These are some of the most frequent methods attackers use to breach systems or steal information:

###  Phishing
- Scams that trick users into revealing sensitive data (like passwords) by pretending to be trustworthy sources

###  Ransomware
- A malicious program that locks your files and demands a ransom to unlock them

###  Malware
- Any software designed to damage or exploit systems, including viruses, worms, spyware, and trojans

###  Social Engineering
- Manipulating people into giving up confidential details by using deception or impersonation

### ðŸ•µ Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack
- When an attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties

###  Zero-Day Exploits
- Attacks that target previously unknown vulnerabilities in software, for which no patch or fix yet exists

##  3. Understanding Hacking

**Hacking** refers to gaining unauthorized access to digital systems. Hackers can be classified into different categories based on their intentions:

- **White Hat Hackers**: Ethical hackers who test and improve security legally  
- **Black Hat Hackers**: Criminal hackers who break into systems to cause harm or steal data  
- **Gray Hat Hackers**: Operate in a legal gray area â€” not always malicious but not always authorized

Ethical hacking plays a critical role in improving cybersecurity defenses by identifying problems before real threats do.
