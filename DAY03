## A. Obfuscation

**Obfuscation** is the practice of intentionally making something harder to understand or interpret — usually code, data, or communication — to protect it from attackers.

### Example in Python

```python
a = "".join([chr(i) for i in [97, 100, 109, 105, 110, 49, 50, 51]])
print("The password is:", a)
